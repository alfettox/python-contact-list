# Phone Book Application

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a larger applicationâ€”a phone book. By completing this project, you will:

- Gain insights into fundamental principles of application development.
- Understand the separation of concerns within an application (user interface, program logic, and file handling).
- Practice building a moderately complex Python application.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout this project, you will:

- Explore how objects and classes help manage complexity in larger programs.
- Embrace the separation of concerns principle in programming.
- Learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) and its real-world modeling capabilities.

### Project Overview
In this project, we will create a phone book application, demonstrating the importance of OOP and modular code design.
